## 📑 Introduction
CUB3D is a project that involves creating a basic raycasting game engine inspired by the classic game Wolfenstein 3D. <br>
It's a visual exploration of raycasting techniques to render a 3D-like environment.

## 🎮️ Description
The CUB3D project challenges you to build a simple game engine that can render a textured maze-like environment in a 2D window. <br>
The core of the project revolves around raycasting, a technique that simulates a 3D perspective by casting rays from the player's viewpoint <br>
and calculating the intersections with walls and other objects. 
The project requirement asked us to parse a map file that defines the layout of the maze, handle player movement, <br>
and render the scene using textures. <br>

The core of the project revolves around raycasting, a technique that simulates a 3D perspective by casting rays from the player's viewpoint <br>
and calculating the intersections with walls and other objects. 
The project requirement asked us to parse a map file that defines the layout of the maze, handle player movement, <br>
and render the scene using textures. <br>
Other features, such as wall collision, jump and such were optional.

## 🛠️ Implementation
Creating the CUB3D game engine asked us to work on the following components:

- Map parsing: Read and interpret the map file that defines the maze layout, textures, and other properties.
- Raycasting: Cast rays to calculate distances to walls and objects in the player's view, creating the 3D-like effect.
- Texturing: Apply textures to walls and other surfaces based on the raycasting results.
- Player movement: Implement controls for player movement, rotation.
- Graphic rendering: Set up a window and render the scene using the MinilibX graphical library

## 💽 Usage
To compile the program, run the following command:
```shell
make
```
It will compile the program and create an executable called "cub3D".<br>


To run the program, simply execute the created executable:
```shell
./cub3D path_to_map.cub
```
